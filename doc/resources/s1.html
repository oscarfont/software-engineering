<!--TASCA 1-->
<br><b><u>Task 1:</u></b> <i>Identify the stakeholders of the project.</i><br>
<blockquote>• OurCode<br> 
• OurCode’s developer team<br>    
• Large editorials<br>  
• MeltingPot<br>  
• OurCode’s maintenance team<br>  
• Clients<br><br></blockquote>

<!--TASCA 2-->
<b><u>Task 2:</u></b> <i>After reading the description of the project carefully, write a list of obscure points.</i><br>
<blockquote>• How do the orders work?<br> 
• How does the numeration of works work? Does it have any conditions?<br> 
• If a work is not numbered how does a User find that work?<br>
• If clients arround the world want to purchase a book or send a donation to the author, what method they will use —credit card, Paypal, in metal, ...— and what type of currency would be used for the transaction —euros, dollars, ...—?<br>
• What should we exactly do to add value to clients? They mention four possible cases and finish the phrase with an "etc.", so it is not completely defined what they want us to implement.<br>
• Talking about the catalogue Updates. How long does it have to take between catalogue automatic Updates?<br>
• How we can exploit the proliferation of editable material under the Creative Commons licence?<br>
• Clients can subscribe to a certain author, collection, or topic they like. Can they also des-subscribe when they want?<br>
• Both authors and editors can unlist works, removing them from the catalogue. What happens then if an author wants to unlist a work but the editor doesn't? And viceversa?<br>
• Talking about to make recommendations of other similar works the clients might want to purchase. They say that are based on what other books clients have downloaded after purchasing the selected work, but which is the relation to make the recommendation —same author, same title, same genre—?<br>
• What happens when the user wants to purchase one book that is not in stock but the company will recieve more copies of it? What does the system have to tell on behalf of the company?<br><br></blockquote>

<!--TASCA 3-->
<b><u>Task 3:</u></b> <i>Write a glossary that defines the meaning of different expressions within the project.</i><br>
<blockquote>
• <b>MeltingPot:</b> The name of a small editorial who wants to redesign and reimplement its system for selling books and other merchandise over the Internet. MeltingPot has started selling their books online, like the large editorials, and this process has become the principal source of its sales. This has allowed the editorial to depend less on distributors, which used to be one of its main problems.<br>
• <b>OurCode:</b> The name of the small company responsable for MeltPot’s redesign and reimplement of its system for selling books.<br>
• <b>OurCode’s Salesperson:</b> This is a person in charge of OurCode’s Sales Department who has been contracted by MeltingPot.<br>
• <b>OurCode’s Developer and Maintanence teams:</b> These are the ones that will develop and mantain the reimplementation and redesign of MeltPot’s system to sell books and other merchandise.<br>
• <b>MeltingPot's current webpage:</b> The current website of MeltingPot contains the catalogue of books on sale, which is updated by hand. This is becoming a tedious process and difficult to maintain, so the editorial needs to redesign the webpage's functioning.<br>
• <b>Creative Commons License:</b> A Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work.<br>
• <b>Watermark:</b> Consists in an image with the logotype and webpage of the editorial that appears across the page.<br>
• <b>Formats:</b> Such as LaTeX, Microsoft Word, OpenOffice Writer, DocBook, Adobe PDF, and HTML. Consist in different formats of the documents that the authors upload to the page depending on wich program they have written the work.<br>
• <b>Layout designer:</b> The Layout designer is a person that translates a work to a standard format.<br>
• <b>Editor:</b> The Editor is a person that validates the layout design and also classifies the work and chooses whether to include the work in one of the editorial’s collections.<br>
• <b>Cover page:</b> A cover page is the principal book's page, which is used to represent the work and cover it. The cover pages of all works in a specific collection have the same format: the only thing that changes is the title, the author, and the image. Work that do not belong to collections also have a common cover page, although in this case the work is not numbered.<br>
• <b>Author:</b> The Author is a person who creates a work.<br>
• <b>Client:</b> The Client is a person who can interact with the website to search a book, purchase a book, rate a work, etc.<br>
• <b>User:</b> The User is a person who can be a designer, an editor, an author or a client. This is a generalized word to talk about every person who interacts with the website.<br>
• <b>Website:</b> The website is the online platform from MeltingPot's editorial to sell their books and provide the website's users the information they need about a work they are looking for.<br>
• <b>Use Case:</b> Describes the interaction between the systems and the actors. It also illustrates a service that the system is supposed to provide and, for each service, who or what will use it.
